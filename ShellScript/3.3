Exercise 3:

Write a script that executes the command "cat /etc/shadow". 
If the command returns a 0 exit status report "Command succeeded" and exit with a 0 exit status. 
If the command returns a nonÂ­zero exit status report "Command failed" and exit with a 1 exit status.

#!/bin/sh

cat /etc/shadow

if [ "$?" -eq "0" ]; then
	echo "Command successded."
	exit 0
else
	echo "Commnad failed."
	exit 1
fi


One mistake need to be addressed: The script following will print "Command successed." instead of "Command failed"
The reason for that is because, we excute an other command echo, and use the exit code of echo in the if.

#!/bin/sh

cat /etc/shadow

echo "Exit status is $?"

if [ "$?" -eq "0" ]; then
	echo "Command successded."
	exit 0
else
	echo "Commnad failed."
	exit 1
fi
