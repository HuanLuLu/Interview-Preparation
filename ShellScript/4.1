Write a shell script that consists of a function that display the number of files in the present working directory. 
Name this function "file_count" and call it in your script. If you use a variable in your function, remember to make it a local variable.

Hint: The wc utility is used to count the number of lines, words, and bytes.


#!/bin/sh

function file_count() {
	local FILE_NUM=$(ls|wc -l)
	echo "There are ${FILE_NUM} files in the present working directory."
}

echo "Practice 4.1"
file_count
