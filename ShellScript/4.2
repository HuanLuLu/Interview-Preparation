Exercise 2:

Modify the script from the previous exercise. Make the "file_count" function accept a directory as an argument. Next have the function display the name of the directory followed by a colon. Finally, display the number of files to the screen on the next line. Call the function three times. First, on the "/etc" directory, next on the "/var" directory and finally on the "/usr/bin" directory.

Example output:

/etc:
85

#!/bin/sh

function file_count() {
	local FILE_NUM=$(ls $1 | wc -l)
	echo "${1}:"
	echo "$FILE_NUM"
}

echo "Practice 4.2"
file_count /etc
file_count /var
file_count /usr/bin
