Exercise 2:
Write a shell script that accepts a file or directory name as an argument. 
Have the script report if it is a regular file, a directory, or other type of file. 
If it is a regular file, exit with a 0 exit status. If it is a directory, exit with a 1 exit status. 
If it is some other type of file, exit with a 2 exit status.

#!/bin/sh

FILE_NAME="nothing"

if [ -f $FILE_NAME ]; then
	echo "$FILE_NAME is a regular file."
	exit 0
elif [ -d $FILE_NAME ]; then
	echo "$FILE_NAME is a directory."
	exit 1
else
	echo "$FILE_NAME is neither a regular file nor a directory."
	exit 2
fi

In the terminal,  type "sh $?" to check the procedure exit status.
